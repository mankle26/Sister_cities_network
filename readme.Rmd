Sister cities are a possibility for cities to connect themselves within a globalized world. This paper elaborates which national factors are decisive for cities to pair with others. Initially, several potentially important factors which could influence the number of twinnings between two countries were identified theoretically and according hypotheses were formulated. These assumptions were tested by applying a mixed methods design. Initially, the global network of sister cities was mapped visually in a network analysis approach. A qualitative analysis of this network suggested that proximity, historical and cultural bounds are especially relevant national factors that drive the foundation of such partnerships. In a second step, these variables are tested quantitatively. A shared border, trade, and a history of war proved to be relevant factors influencing the decision on where cities look for partners.
